# en-vivo

🎉 Welcome to En Vivo! 🎉.

Not just another chat app

## Getting Set Up

We'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed to run the project locally.

1. Start by cloning this repository.

2. In the repo root directory, run `npm install` to gather all dependencies.

3. Then run `npm dev` which should start both the server and the React client.

## Technical Notes

- The node server is running with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) on port 5000, which will automatically restart for you when you modify and save a file.
- The frontend is using the [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started). Any changes in the client should hot reloaded on port 3000.

Thanks for taking the time to check out this project! 🙏
